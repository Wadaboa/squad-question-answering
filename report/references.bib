The precision of word sense disambiguation by using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 Wall Street Journal (20M total words) was higher than that by using distance vectors from the Collins English Dictionary (60K head words + 1.6M definition words). However, other experimental results suggest that distance vectors contain some different semantic information from co-occurrence vectors.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper explores the possibility of using multiplicative gates to build two recurrent neural network structures. These two structures are called Deep Simple Gated Unit (DSGU) and Simple Gated Unit (SGU), which are structures for learning long-term dependencies. Compared to traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both structures require fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classification tasks. Unlike GRU and LSTM, which require more than one gate to control information flow in the network, SGU and DSGU only use one multiplicative gate to control the flow of information. We show that this difference can accelerate the learning speed in tasks that require long dependency information. We also show that DSGU is more numerically stable than SGU. In addition, we also propose a standard way of representing the inner structure of RNN called RNN Conventional Graph (RCG), which helps to analyze the relationship between input units and hidden units of RNN.}

@misc{bert,
  abstract  = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands
for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent
language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep
bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right
context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be
fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art
models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language
inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new
state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including
pushing the GLUE benchmark to 80.4% (7.6% absolute improvement), MultiNLI
accuracy to 86.7 (5.6% absolute improvement) and the SQuAD v1.1 question
answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5% absolute improvement), outperforming human
performance by 2.0%.},
